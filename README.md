   ```powershell
   python passgen.py
   ```

2. **Set Your Preferences:**
   - Adjust the password length using the spinbox.

## Options Explained

- **Length:** Number of characters in the password (6-32).
- **Uppercase:** Includes A-Z.
- **Lowercase:** Includes a-z.
- **Numbers:** Includes 0-9.
- **Symbols:** Includes special characters (e.g., !@#$%^&*).

> _Tip: For maximum security, use a mix of all character sets and a longer length._

## How It Works

- The application uses Python's `random` and `string` modules to assemble a pool of characters based on your selections.
- When you click **Generate**, it randomly selects characters from this pool to create a password of your chosen length.
- The password is displayed in a read-only field and can be copied to your clipboard.
- If no character sets are selected, the app will prompt you to select at least one.

## Security Considerations

- Passwords are generated locally on your machine and are **not** sent over the internet.
- Clipboard contents can be accessed by other applications; clear your clipboard after use if security is a concern.
- For highly sensitive accounts, consider using a dedicated password manager.

## Troubleshooting

- **Tkinter Not Found:**

  On some Linux distributions, you may need to install Tkinter separately:

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install python3-tk
  ```

- **App Won't Start:**
  - Ensure you are running Python 3.x.
  - Check for typos in the filename or command.

- **Clipboard Issues:**
  - Some remote desktop or virtual environments may restrict clipboard access.
